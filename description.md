## Webinar on societal impact in the language sciences

Impact, valorisation, outreach, knowledge transfer, public engagement: these are all terms which are used, or have been used, to refer to the way in which scientists make their findings available to a non-academic audience. In recent years, there has been a move among universities and funding agencies to actively encourage and sometimes even require researchers to not only do the research, but to also devote time to generating societal impact. There are a whole host of ways in which individual researchers and universities fulfil this task, from writing popular science pieces (e.g., blogs), going into schools, organising science festivals, providing advice and information services for parents and teachers, developing products for use by business, health and education professionals. 

### Promoting language science as science
More often than not, the first image that comes to mind when members of the general public think of a scientist is someone in a white lab coat using technical equipment in a laboratory setting. Being a *language scientist* or doing *language science* is off most people's radars. Yet, language is something that everyone uses, it's a topic that many people have an opinion about, and it's something that – with some help – most people can readily think about. As such, it easily lends itself to valorisation and outreach activities. Nevertheless, the prevailing image when it comes to “doing science” is far removed from the type of research language scientists typically conduct. Kletskoppen’s goal is to change this, not only because we believe language offers the general public an accessible window into science and scientific methods, but also to highlight the importance of our field(s) to society at a time when universities and funding agencies are faced with increasingly tighter budgets.

### First steps - Kletskoppen
Over the past four years we have taken the first steps in achieving this goal, organising four successful [child language festivals](https://kletskoppenfestival.nl/archief/) for children and their families in Nijmegen and The Hague, as well as smaller scale activities in the run-up to the festival designed to attract a more diverse audience. Whilst some of our activities have inevitably been put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to funding from Radboud University’s Executive Board and the [Dutch Research Agenda](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/dutch-research-agenda-nwa), we are currently developing plans to take Kletskoppen on the road to other locations in and around Nijmegen and to other regions in the country. 

### Exchanging ideas and experiences
Kletskoppen is of course just one example of how language scientists are generating societal impact here in the Netherlands, and we know that there are many colleagues across the world who are also engaged in similar endeavours. We believe that just as we all benefit from coming together at conferences and webinars to present our research findings, exchange ideas, and expand our networks, similar benefits are there for the taking when it comes to our impact activities. For this reason we have decided to organise a small-scale, international webinar, where we bring together **language scientists from around the world who are already engaged in activities designed to generate societal impact**. We use the term language scientists to refer to researchers whose objective of study is language and how it is learned, used and/or processed, irrespective of the field they come from. Our **aim** is to exchange lessons learned and best practices, and as a result take the first steps in establishing a network for further dialogue (and potentially funding applications). To this end, we are inviting a number of colleagues from the Netherlands and abroad whose profiles together reflect a range of perspectives, topics, and/or type of impact activity.

### Format of the webinar
The **format** involves a mix of short presentations and small group discussions. The **short presentations** (10-min + 10-min questions) will showcase concrete examples of successful impact activities. Three presenters share at least one activity of which they are particularly proud. In addition, presenters will be asked to reflect on any issues they have encountered whilst developing this activity and how they dealt with this. In the group discussions, participants are invited to exchange experiences in three breakout sessions structured around different topics. These are: 
(1) How to reach a diverse and inclusive audience?
(2) How to measure (societal) impact?
(3) How to embed impact activities in the structure of the university?  

### Intended outcomes
Our intended **outcomes** are that at the end of the webinar:
* participants will be energised, inspired, and keen to contribute further;
* Kletskoppen will produce a document summarising the main points discussed, along with any materials made available to share, which will be distributed to all participants afterwards;
* we will have the basis for a network of language scientists around the world who are actively engaged in societal impact and who are committed to sharing and further developing their expertise and experiences in the spirit of open science.

### Next steps
Our intended **next steps** are:
* to organise a larger webinar open to more language scientists and related organisations, including those actively engaged in impact activities as well as those without any such experience; 
* to investigate opportunities for funding such a network.
